Upon launching the program you will be prosented with input field for you to insert a XLSX file. Once you do that, and hit "convert" the Excel sheet will be converted into an array of objects. 

The user can then enter a Pitcher Name or ID and a Batter Name or ID. If a player's name is entered, it should be enetered in the format Last Name, First Name. 

If both fields are typed in, the program will update the view if there is a match. In other words, if in the Excel sheet, there is a row that has that pitcher batter matchup. 

If only one field is filled in, then the program will update the view with the first instance of the input found. 

For example, if only the batter's ID is filled in, then the view will show the first instance of that batter within the array and the information from that row. 

The updated view will show the pitcher and batter's names followed by their headshots and the play's outcome.

Under that, there will be a table with the rest of the stats and the video of the play. 

At the bottom of the screen, you will find a "Back" button that will take you to the initial view where you can once again put in a player id or name.
