<!-- 
    -- The id attributes in the HTML elements should not include the # 
    -- the function on the document takes in the event but the updateXY function wasn't. I included the event within the updateXY() to use it when updating x and y.
    -- The variables within the updateXY() are declared within the function meaning that they can only be accessed from within that function. So I moved their declaration out of the function to give them a global scope.
    -- dist is never declared so I added that declaration
    -- I changed the format of the original code to use the .addEventListener instead
    -- and fill in the span elements using .textContent

    -- I added the log statement at the beginnign to make sure the event was being logged
